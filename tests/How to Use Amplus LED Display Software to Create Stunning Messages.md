## How to Connect Your LED Display Board to Your Computer
 
To connect your LED display board to your computer, you need a RS232 cable or a USB adapter. The RS232 cable is a 9-pin serial port cable that connects your LED display board to the COM port of your computer. The USB adapter is a device that converts the RS232 signal to a USB signal that can be recognized by your computer.
 
If you are using a RS232 cable, plug one end of the cable into the RS232 port of your LED display board and the other end into the COM port of your computer. If you are using a USB adapter, plug one end of the adapter into the RS232 port of your LED display board and the other end into a USB port of your computer.
 
Once you have connected your LED display board to your computer, you need to set up the communication parameters in Amplus LED display software. Click on the Communication button on the toolbar or go to Communication > Communication Setting. You should see a window like this:

Here you can select the COM port number that matches the port where you plugged in your RS232 cable or USB adapter. You can also select the baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity that match the specifications of your LED display board. The default values are 9600 baud rate, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. Click OK when you are done.
 
## How to Create and Edit Text and Graphic Messages
 
To create a new message, click on the New button on the toolbar or go to File > New. You should see a window like this:
